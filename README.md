# IPSSI-Malware

# First Part 

Two files: server & client 

- Execute server (in the directory): python server.py 
- Execute client (in the directory): python client.py 

The client is a piece of malware which, once launched on an infected machine, connects to the server via socket.
 
It can offer the client several options:

- list all files on the client machine
- download a file from the client's machine	
- encrypt all files on the client machine

# Second Part 

We have made a simple C2 server and Backdoor in python however,
we have only covered the surface of what is possible to achieve with the C2-Backdoor exploitation model.

We understand how server and clients work as well as the fundamentals of socket communication,
however our C2 server and backdoor is still not useful enough to be used in a red team or penetrating testing operation. 
The primary objective of a backdoor is to execute commands that are sent to it via the C2 server. 
We can achieve this by using another useful python library called “subprocess” and “os” which allows the execution of terminal 
commands in python code. Ranging from deleting or creating files, navigating file systems or reading and writing to files are all possible.

Server: 

This C2 version allows a user to input data and communicate with the backdoor. 
We have a new function called “backdoor_comms” that has the primary task of directly communicating to the backdoor’s “shell” function.

Client: 

The command that is sent from the C2 will be received and stored into the command variable. 
The If statement will check it the instruction received has the initial keyword “cd”  any other commands will be processed by 
subprocess.getoutput function and the output data is passed back to the C2 server.

We choose backdoor malware because it's the first malware we thought of. 
So we tried to demonstrate the simplest way to make one.
