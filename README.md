Two files: server & client 

- Execute server (in the directory): python server.py 
- Execute client (in the directory): python client.py 

The client is a piece of malware which, once launched on an infected machine, connects to the server via socket.
 
- it can offer the client several options:

- list all files on the client machine
- download a file from the client's machine	
- encrypt all files on the client machine
